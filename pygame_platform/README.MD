* I have been having tremendous troubles setting up the dev environment in other machines. Just making a note of python and pygame versions.
* I m guessing there are some more dependencies with mac os , xcode , nsdraw and other audio packages which is making it harder to set this up again elsewhere.Will have those errors documented as well here.
